Test	: Time precision test inter-FPGA with ~12ns difference.
Date	: 04.03.2014
Design	: trb3_periph_32PinAddOn_20131108.bit

Setup	: 10KHz NIM pulse (80% duty) is generated with the Random Pulse
	  Generator and fed to the LevCon. The LVDS output is fed to the LVDS
	  splitter with the Differential-LEMO connectors and the 2 output
	  signals are fed to pins 1 of each FPGA on the trb3 (see raw data
	  table for more details). TDC channel 1 is leading and 2 is trailing
	  edges with ToT ~20us.

Results : The time differences between the channels ch0-ch0 and ch1-ch1 are
	  calculated for all of the six FPGA combinations. The reference
	  channel cross measurement precision is below <17ps except the
	  combinations of the FPGA2. This value for FPGA2 combinations gets 
	  as worse as 53ps, like in the interFOGA/Difference_0ns
	  measurements. The plot for each measurement is shown in
	  fpga1-2-3-4_ch0-0_ch1-1.root. The effect of the bad clock signal at
	  the FPGA2 is also observed in the inter-FPGA measurements. For
	  details see the inFPGA measurements.
