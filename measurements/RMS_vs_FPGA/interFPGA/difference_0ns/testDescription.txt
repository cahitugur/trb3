Test	: Time precision test inter-FPGA with <2ns difference.
Date	: 04.03.2014
Design	: trb3_periph_32PinAddOn_20131108.bit

Setup	: 10KHz NIM pulse (80% duty) is generated with the Random Pulse
	  Generator and fed to the LevCon. The LVDS output is fed to the LVDS
	  Fan-Out board from J. FrÃ¼hauf and the 4 output signals are fed to
	  FPGA pairs on the trb3 (see raw data table for more details). TDC
	  channels 1-7 are leading and 2-8 are trailing edges with ToT ~20us.

Results : The time differences between the channels ch0-ch0, ch1-ch1 and
	  ch7-ch1 are calculated for all of the six FPGA combinations. The
	  reference channel cross measurement precision is below <17ps except
	  the combinations of the FPGA2. This value for FPGA2 combinations get
	  as worse as 53ps. The plot for each measurement is shown in
	  fpga1-2-3-4_ch0-0_ch1-1_ch7-1.root. The effect of the bad clock
	  signal at the FPGA2 is also observed in the inter-FPGA
	  measurements. For details see the inFPGA measurements.

fpga3-4_0ns_0001.hld		FPGA: 3-4  Channel: 1-2-7-8 taken few days
				later, as in fpga3-4_0ns_0000.hld extra peaks
				were seen, which are not seen in the
				fpga3-4_0ns_0001.hld. Most probably they come
				from the analysis. Sergey is contacted. For
				this test fpga3-4_0ns_0001.hld is used.
