SETUP
===== 
Hit Rate	: 30 KHz from Jochen's card
Trigger Rate	: 30 KHz (Not correlated with the hits)
TDC Clock	: External 200 MHz from Closy through TRBDIST1 board
TDCs		: On 2 different TRB3 boards FPGA1
Power		: Enpirion DC-DC converters with 4 MHz external synchron clock

Calibration	: Auto calibration with 500 000 hits
Statistics	: Minimum 500 000 hits for the histograms
Histogram calc.	: Direct time difference calculation without the reference
	  	  time
RMS (typical ch): Average-16,6 ps  Best-14 ps  Worst-21 ps
RMS (best ch)	: Averate-15,3 ps  Best-13 ps  Worst-19 ps
RMS (worst ch)	: Averate-22,8 ps  Best-18 ps  Worst-30 ps

Notes		: The precision measurements between 2 TRB3 boards show bad
		  resolution (>40 ps). This effect is narrowed down to the
		  DC-DC converters. As these converters are switching
		  converters sampling with 4 MHz internal clock, the ripple on
		  different boards are not synchronised and cause bad
		  resolution. Therefore these DC-DC converters are driven by 4
		  MHz clock generated in the cetral FPGAs, which use external
		  200 MHz clock from CLOSY. In this case the ripples are
		  always synchronised and have the same differential voltage
		  between them. The RMS is stable during the measurements but
		  depending on the phase offset of the 4 MHz clocks (which
		  changes after every power cycle) the precision changes
		  between 14 ps and 43 ps (for a typical channel). In order to
		  limit the change in the phase offset of the 4MHz clocks a
		  common reset signal is generated and applied to the PLLs in
		  the cetral FPGAs. Thus, assuming the lock time of the PLLs
		  are similar and constant in every FPGA, the offset
		  difference is kept smaller and the RMS change is limited to
		  14 ps - 21 ps for a typical channel.

Root Files
==========
0phase.root	Time measurements between every channel of the 2 TDCs on 2
		TRB3s after the PLLs are reset with a common reset and the
		ripple phase is around 0 degrees.
180phase.root	Time measurements between every channel of the 2 TDCs on 2
		TRB3s without the PLLs are reset with a common reset and the
		ripple phase is around 180 degrees.
