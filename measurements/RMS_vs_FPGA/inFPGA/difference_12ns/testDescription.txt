Test	: Time precision test in the same FPGA with ~12ns difference.
Date	: 03.03.2014
Design	: trb3_periph_32PinAddOn_20131108.bit

Setup	: 10KHz NIM pulse (80% duty) is generated with the Random Pulse
	  Generator and fed to the LevCon. The LVDS output is fed to the LVDS
	  splitter with the Differential-LEMO connectors and the 2 output
	  signals are fed to pins 1-4 of each FPGA on the trb3 (see raw data
	  table for more details). TDC channels 1-7 are leading and 2-8 are
	  trailing edges with ToT ~20us.

Results : The time differences between the channels ch7-ch1 are calculated for
	  all of the four FPGAs on the trb3. The measured means are around
	  ~12.7 The precisions of the 4 FPGAs are around ~18ps except the
	  FPGA2, which is ~27ps. When combined with the "Difference_0ns"
	  results, the difference between the precision of FPGA2 and the other
	  FPGAs increase, as the measured time interval between the hit signals
	  increases, because the jitter induced by the clock signal gets more
	  dominant by each clock period passes.
