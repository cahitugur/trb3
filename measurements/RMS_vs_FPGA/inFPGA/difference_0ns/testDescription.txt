Test	: Time precision test in the same FPGA with <2ns difference.
Date	: 03.03.2014
Design	: trb3_periph_32PinAddOn_20131108.bit

Setup	: 10KHz NIM pulse (80% duty) is generated with the Random Pulse
	  Generator and fed to the LevCon. The LVDS output is fed to the LVDS
	  Fan-Out board from J. Frühauf and the 4 output signals are fed to
	  FPGA pairs on the trb3 (see raw data table for more details). TDC
	  channels 1-3-5-7 are leading and 2-4-6-8 are trailing edges with ToT
	  ~20us.

Results : The time differences between the channels ch3-ch1, ch5-ch1 and
	  ch7-ch1 are calculated for all of the four FPGAs on the trb3. The
	  measured means are ~0.15ns, ~-0.7ns and ~-1.4ns respectively. The
	  precisions of the 4 FPGAs get worse as the mean deviates from ~0ns,
	  which is known due to the noise from the DC-DC converters on the
	  trb3 board [1]. However, the degree of the worsening on FPGA2 (~9ps)
	  is much bigger than the all of the other three FPGAs (~4ps). This
	  error comes from the jitter induced by the clock signal, which
	  becomes more dominant as the time difference deviates from the
	  multiple of the clock period, as the times measured in the channels
	  are against the different clock edges.
