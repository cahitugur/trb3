Test	: Time precision test in the same FPGA for the 32PinAddOn design.
Date	: 23.04.2014
Design	: trb3_periph_32PinAddOn_dbl_alt_64ch_20140423.bit

Setup	: 100KHz NIM pulse (80% duty) is generated with the Random Pulse
	  Generator and fed to the LevCon. The LVDS output is fed to the LVDS
	  Fan-Out board from J. Frühauf and the 4 output signals are fed to
	  FPGA pairs on the trb3 (see raw data table for more details). TDC
	  channels 26-28-30-32 are leading and 25-27-29-31 are trailing edges
	  with ToT ~2us. The same signal from the pulser is also fed to the
	  trigger input of the CTS. Although a CBM-TOF FEE is also connected
	  to the system, none of the channels are on.

Results : The time differences between the channels ch28-ch26, ch30-ch26 and
	  ch32-ch26 are calculated. Only the time difference ch28-ch26 is
	  usable as the cable to the other channels is damaged. The 
	  precisions of the 4 FPGAs get worse as the mean deviates from ~0ns,
	  which is known due to the noise from the DC-DC converters on the
	  trb3 board [1]. However, the degree of the worsening on FPGA2 (~9ps)
	  is much bigger than the all of the other three FPGAs (~4ps). This
	  error comes from the jitter induced by the clock signal, which
	  becomes more dominant as the time difference deviates from the
	  multiple of the clock period, as the times measured in the channels
	  are against the different clock edges.
