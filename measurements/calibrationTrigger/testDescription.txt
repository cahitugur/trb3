Test	: Calibration quality test using the internal oscillator
Date	: 03.07.2014
Design	: trb3_periph_32PinAddOn_20140307_debug.bit

Setup	: In order to collect data for calibration the internal oscillator is
	  set at ~25KHz frequency as the hit generator and data is collected
	  with "tdc_calibration_trigger" set at 50KHz. As tdc data the Tester
	  Board is set as a pulse generator at ~25KHz and the system is
	  triggered with the same pulse.

Results : In order to test the calibration quality using the internal
	  oscillator of the FPGA two sets of data are collected: 1-internal
	  oscillator as the hit generator, 2-external pulser (Tester Board) as
	  the hit generator. Two different calibration data are generated
	  using the two .hld files with the similar number of hits (~500k) and
	  the same data is analysed (external.hld) using the two calibration
	  data. The results show that the calculated mean from both
	  calibration files differ ~10ps at most. However the precision is
	  around ~1ps worse, when the internal oscillator is used as the hit
	  generator for the calibration.
